We are always happy to welcome new team members who are excited about neuro data science, new methodological and technical 
developments for a more open and reproducible neuroscience.

##  Research Assistant
We are looking for a motivated research assistant with an interest in neuroimaging 
to work with us on making large neuroimaging datasets discoverable and reusable. 
You will be joining an exciting multi-national team of neuroimaging researchers and technical professionals 
who work on developing tools and standards for data sharing in neuroimaging. 

In your role you will work with the [MNI community](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/) 
and our international collaborators, under the supervision of [S. Urchs]({{ site.baseurl }}/#people),
on providing access to high quality neuroimaging data and rich meta-data. 
You will help develop solutions to link these meta-data with existing graph databases 
and to enable researchers to search in a detailed way for neuroimaging datasets.

Your work will involve three main areas:
- organizing and curating large neuroimaging datasets 
  according to data standards like [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)
- preprocessing neuroimaging data with common neuroimaging preprocessing pipelines 
(like FSL, freesurfer, AFNI) on a distributed compute cluster
- exploring and implementing tools to extract rich meta-data and provenance information 
  for neuroimaging datasets and ways to model these information with knowledge graph data models
  
For additional details like hours and compensation, please take a look at the job posting [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/RA_job_posting_0721.pdf).

To apply, please send an email with your cover letter and CV to:
