My PhD thesis focuses on building a normal brain aging model with MRI imaging data that models the conditional quantile of the aging process. To achieve this task,  statistical tools are in need to validate high-dimensional quantile models, and to select the best model. Iâ€™m working on proposing a kernel-based lack-of-fit test now, and it will be extended to a model selection criterion in the future. The application in UKBiobank data will provide clinical assessment of individual brain development.
