Functional Connectivity (FC) has emerged as an important measure for understanding brain function as well as a biomarker with significant potential. 
FC assessment was initially performed under the stationarity assumption. However, growing evidence supports that the dynamical variations of FC (dynamic FC – dFC) has a critical role related to brain function (Savva et al., 2019). FC has been commonly assessed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. Despite its excellent spatial resolution, fMRI has a low temporal resolution, making fMRI controversial for being used for a “high-temporal-resolution-requiring” measurement like dFC. Therefore, one of the main goals of this project is to enhance the temporal resolution of fMRI data. Built upon the enhanced fMRI data, we will then be able to carry out a high-resolution dFC assessment which will promote us a deeper understanding of dFC sources and more importantly, brain functional organization.
A higher resolution and more accurate dFC assessment will promote a better understanding of dFC sources and will also encourage us to investigate the causal relations between brain regions. Investigating the causal relations will subsequently lead to a deeper comprehension of the healthy and diseased brain, which will eventually provide more robust biomarkers for brain disease diagnosis and prognosis. 

Here are different stages of the project:
●	Reviewing different proposed measures of dynamic FC (dFC), and assessing their reproducibility, robustness, and accuracy
●	Increasing the data resolution by integrating data from EEG and fMRI, the two most popular neuroimaging modalities
●	Generating brain networks based on the assessed dynamic functional connections and utilizing the resulting networks to extract more reliable biomarkers
